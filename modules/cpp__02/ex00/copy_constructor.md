### What is this function?

This is the **copy constructor** for the `Fixed` class.  
A copy constructor is called when we create a new object as a copy of an existing object, for example:

```cpp
Fixed a;
Fixed b(a); // <-- copy constructor is called here
```

### What does it do?

1. **Prints a message:**  
   It prints `"Copy constructor called"` to the console, so we know when this constructor is used.

2. **Copies the data:**  
   The line `*this = other;` uses the assignment operator (`operator=`) to copy the contents of `other` into the current object (`*this`).  
   This means all the member variables of `other` are copied to the new object.

### Why use `*this = other;`?

- This is a common way to avoid repeating code.  
- The assignment operator (`operator=`) already knows how to copy all the data members, so the copy constructor just reuses that logic.

### What happens inside `operator=`?

From our code:
```cpp
Fixed& Fixed::operator=(Fixed const& a) {
    this->fixed_pt = a.getRawBits();
    return(*this);
}
```
- It copies the `fixed_pt` value from `a` to `this`.

### Summary

- The copy constructor creates a new `Fixed` object as a copy of another.
- It prints a message and copies the data using the assignment operator.

**Example usage:**
```cpp
Fixed a;
a.setRawBits(42);
Fixed b(a); // Copy constructor is called, b gets the same value as a
```
