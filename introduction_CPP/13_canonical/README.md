### What is "Canonical" in C++?

In C++, a **canonical class** is a class that follows a standard way of defining its special member functions. These are:

1. **Default constructor** (`Sample()`)
2. **Copy constructor** (`Sample(const Sample &src)`)
3. **Copy assignment operator** (`Sample &operator=(const Sample &rhs)`)
4. **Destructor** (`~Sample()`)

This set is often called the **Rule of Three**.

### Why is it important?

- **Consistency:** It makes your class behave correctly when copied, assigned, or destroyed.
- **Resource Management:** If your class manages resources (like memory, files, etc.), you need to control how copies and assignments work to avoid bugs like double-free or memory leaks.
- **Standard Practice:** Other programmers expect these functions to exist and behave in a certain way.

---

### Why is `Sample & operator=(Sample const & rhs);` interesting?

This is the **copy assignment operator**. It lets you write code like:

```cpp
Sample a;
Sample b;
a = b; // This uses operator=
```

If you don’t define it, C++ will create a default one for you, but it might not do what you want (especially if your class manages resources).

---

### Example

Suppose your class manages a pointer:

```cpp
class Example {
    int* data;
public:
    Example() : data(new int(0)) {}
    ~Example() { delete data; }
    // ...copy constructor and assignment operator needed!
};
```

If you don’t write a proper copy constructor and assignment operator, copying `Example` objects will cause both to point to the same memory, and deleting one will break the other.

---

### Good Practices

- **Follow the Rule of Three:** If you need one (copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor), you probably need all three.
- **Use `const` and references:** For efficiency and correctness.
- **Return `*this` in assignment operator:** To allow chaining (`a = b = c;`).

---

### Extra Context

- **Rule of Five:** If you use C++11 or newer and your class manages resources, also consider move constructor and move assignment operator.
- **If you don’t need custom behavior, use `= default` or `= delete`** to make your intent clear.

---

**Summary:**  
Canonical form is a C++ best practice for safe, predictable, and maintainable classes, especially when your class manages resources. The copy assignment operator is a key part of this, ensuring objects can be assigned safely.
