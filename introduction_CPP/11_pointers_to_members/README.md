```cpp
// This function demonstrates how to use pointers to members and member functions in C++.
int	main()
{
		Sample	instance;
		Sample*	instancep = &instance;

		int		Sample::*p = NULL;
		void	(Sample::*f)(void) const;

		p = &Sample::foo;
		std::cout << "Value of member foo: " << instance.foo << std::endl;
		instance.*p = 21;
		std::cout << "Value of member foo: " << instance.foo << std::endl; 
		instance.*p = 41;
		std::cout << "Value of member foo: " << instance.foo << std::endl;

		f = &Sample::bar;

		(instance.*f)();
		(instancep->*f)();

		return (0);
}
```


## 1. **Pointer to Object**

```cpp
Sample instance;
Sample* instancep = &instance;
```
- `Sample instance;` creates an object.
- `Sample* instancep = &instance;` creates a pointer to that object.
- **Why?** Pointers let you refer to objects indirectly, pass them to functions, or manage them dynamically.

---

## 2. **Pointer to Data Member**

```cpp
int Sample::*p = NULL;
p = &Sample::foo;
```
- `int Sample::*p` means: “p is a pointer to an `int` member of class `Sample`.”
- `p = &Sample::foo;` makes `p` point to the member variable `foo` inside any `Sample` object.
- **Usage:**
		- `instance.*p = 21;` sets `instance.foo` to 21.
		- If you have a pointer to the object: `instancep->*p = 42;`
- **Why?** Useful for generic code, like when you want to select which member to access at runtime.

---

## 3. **Pointer to Member Function**

```cpp
void (Sample::*f)(void) const;
f = &Sample::bar;
```
- `void (Sample::*f)(void) const;` means: “f is a pointer to a const member function of `Sample` that takes no arguments and returns nothing.”
- `f = &Sample::bar;` makes `f` point to the `bar` function.
- **Usage:**
		- `(instance.*f)();` calls `bar` on `instance`.
		- `(instancep->*f)();` calls `bar` on the object pointed to by `instancep`.
- **Why?** Lets you call different functions dynamically, like callbacks.

---

## 4. **Good Practices**

- **Initialize pointers** (here, `p = NULL;`) to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Check pointers** before using them, especially if they might be null.
- **Use smart pointers** (like `std::unique_ptr`) for object pointers when possible.
- **Pointer to member syntax is tricky:**  
	- Use `object.*pointer` for objects.
	- Use `pointerToObject->*pointer` for pointers to objects.

---

## 5. **Why is this important?**

- **Flexibility:** Lets you write code that can work with different members or functions at runtime.
- **Generic programming:** Useful in frameworks, serialization, or GUI code where you don’t know in advance which member or function you’ll use.

---

## 6. **Extra Context**

- **Pointer to member** is not the same as a regular pointer.  
	- Regular pointer: points to a memory address.
	- Pointer to member: points to a member “slot” inside any object of that class.
- **Syntax is different:**  
	- `object.*memberPointer`  
	- `pointerToObject->*memberPointer`

---

## 7. **Simple Example**

```cpp
struct MyStruct {
		int x;
		void show() const { std::cout << x << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
		MyStruct obj;
		int MyStruct::*ptr = &MyStruct::x;
		void (MyStruct::*func)() const = &MyStruct::show;

		obj.*ptr = 10;      // Set x to 10
		(obj.*func)();      // Call show()
}
```

---

**Summary:**  
Pointers to members and member functions are advanced C++ features that let you write flexible and generic code. They’re powerful, but the syntax is tricky—always initialize and use them carefully!
